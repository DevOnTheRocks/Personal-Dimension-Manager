# Personal Dim Manager

Personal Dimension manager is a plugin that automates the creation of duplicate dimensions for players. 
It was created to handle creating copies of [Forever Stranded Lost Souls](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/forever-stranded-lost-souls)â€™s nether save that is required to play the pack as intended (easter eggs and all). 
It is in the early stages of development but has been used successfully on my server for a few months!
